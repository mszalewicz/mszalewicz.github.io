For the past year, I’ve placed a strong emphasis on writing things down. Too many times over the years, I promised myself I’d remember crucial pieces of information, only to forget them within a month. That’s why I started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) — and I’ve absolutely fallen in love with it. The app helps me organize and store everything I value, whether it’s programming knowledge or a list of things I want to watch.

The concept of writing things down is simple, but before this, my knowledge was scattered across countless places and files. Switching to an app designed specifically for note-taking and knowledge organization has been a major quality-of-life improvement.

One of the main ways I'm using Obsidian is through lists. The issue with lists is that they can feel dull when they're only presented in text form. While this works for listing resources like documentation websites, it's less effective in other situations where information could be better represented with a more engaging medium, such as thumbnails. Fortunately, since Obsidian is a markdown app, it has a built-in feature to render [iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) from links — such as embedded YouTube videos or Twitter posts. To display them, we simply need to use the syntax for embedding links:

```

Great, if we use it with

extraction of video id
```go
```


construction of custom link
```go

```
